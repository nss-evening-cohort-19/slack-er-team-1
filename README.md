## Target Audience

The Slack-er target audience is primarily for any group that needs to connect remotely to share information or text based conversation. It is a great app for businesses to use as a communication hub for employees, but could also function well as a place for a wedding or family reunion to be planned, or as a place for classmates and instructors to share classnotes and real time questions without having to interject audibly during class or presentations.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Purpose

This app's purpose is to streamline group chat functions and to create and effective and fun experience for the kind of communication that has too often been considered mundane or bland. Here at Slack-er we aim to make sharing ideas, details, plans, and assignments entertaining and engaging while making sure it is also easy and intuitive. Group endeavors already require so much coordination, so we want to provide a tool that makes that coordination enjoyable.
